# Clearview Salesforce Project

This is a capstone Salesforce implementation for a pharmaceutical client. It covers Admin, Apex, LWC, Integration, and DevOps.

## Week 1 Goals
- Setup project and org
- Design ER diagram
- Create documentation folder

## Docs folder contents
- `er-diagram.png` — ER diagram (placeholder in repo; replace with exported PNG from Lucidchart or diagrams.net)
- `design.md` — design notes and object/field summaries
- `daily-progress.md` — daily progress log (create and update daily)

Guidance:
- Keep diagram exports in `/docs` alongside the design notes.
- Add short daily entries to `daily-progress.md` to track progress, decisions and links to diagrams.
